A website, created by a web designer or developer, acts as <strong>digital real estate on the internet</strong>. This makes it easier to be found and increases your customer reach throughout the internet. It's meant to <strong>promote your business, both administratively and commercially</strong>, depending on your goals.</p><p>Want to attract customers and let them easily request a quote? With a website, customers can fill out a form, after which you receive the request by email, SMS, or WhatsApp. This is just one of many options. Another example is a contact form for potential customer inquiries. You can also integrate a small CRM system for customer, user, or employee management, making everything easily organized.</p><p>In short, a website is digital real estate on the internet that increases your findability and offers various ways to make contact and strengthen your business. About 70% of businesses have a website, and potential customers are <strong>less likely to become your customer if they discover your business doesn't have a website</strong>.</p>",
